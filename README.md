# Cantera Workshop & Forum

## Sunday, March 4, 1:00 â€“ 4:00 PM
## Pennsylvania State University

Cantera is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics,
thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This Workshop & Forum will cover basic usage of Cantera, getting started with Cantera development,
and a discussion panel regarding future directions for Cantera. The Workshop will be hosted by the
Bryan Weber, one of the contributing developers to Cantera.

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend! Please fill out the form
